> My project for building an insurance website covering motor, health and other insurance options in India. Still learning and improving! 🚀

## 🎯 What This Project Is About

Hey! I'm a student working on this insurance website as part of my web development learning journey. It's a simple website that covers basic insurance needs in India like bike insurance, car insurance, health insurance and some other stuff.

**What I'm trying to build:**
- 🏍️ Motor insurance for bikes and cars
- 🏥 Health insurance plans
- ✈️ Travel insurance 
- 🏠 Basic home insurance
- Simple user interface to browse and compare plans

## 🛠️ Tech Stack I'm Using

**Frontend:**
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (the basics!)
- Bootstrap for making it look decent
- Maybe some React if I figure it out 😅


**Tools:**
- VS Code as my editor
- Git for version control (still getting used to it)
- Deployed on Vercel (whatever works)

## 🚀 Features I've Built So Far

✅ **Done:**
- Basic homepage with navigation
- Motor insurance quote calculator (kinda works)
- Health insurance plans display
- Contact form (doesn't send emails yet)
- Responsive design (looks okay on mobile)

🔄 **Working On:**
- User registration and login
- Better design (it's pretty basic right now)
- Payment integration (scary but exciting)
- Making the quote calculator actually accurate

❌ **To-Do (if I have time):**
- Admin panel for managing policies
- Email notifications
- Better mobile experience
- Add more insurance types

## 🎓 What I'm Learning

This project is helping me understand:

## 🐛 Known Issues

- Quote calculator might give weird results sometimes
- Contact form doesn't actually send emails
- Design could be way better (I'm not a designer!)
- Some pages load slowly
- Need to add proper error handling
